📧 Email Spam Classifier:

This project is a Machine Learning based Email Spam Classifier that predicts whether an email is Spam or Not Spam (Ham). It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify emails with high accuracy.

🚀 Features:

Classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam
Uses NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
Trained on a labeled dataset of spam/ham emails
Implements machine learning algorithms like Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc
Easy-to-use interface for predictions

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python 🐍
Scikit-learn for ML models
NLTK / SpaCy for text preprocessing
Pandas, NumPy for data handling
